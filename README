Web Browser ‚Üê Camera

To build this you'll first need to checkout and build the WebRTC native libraries into
the directory webrtc. (Or bind/symlink/etc. that to where it is.)

http://www.webrtc.org/reference/getting-started can guide you through that.

Once that's done go install should work as expected to produce the webcam binary.
